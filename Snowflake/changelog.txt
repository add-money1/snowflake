		snowflake.core.manager.ChunkMergingManager
			-> changed add(Chunk) so that false will be returned when the argument is null
			-> mergeChunks(int) now triggers the garbage collection after finishing the merging
	
	
	
	2016.01.06
	
		snowflake.core.flake.FlakeDataManager
			-> changed the way mergeChunks() used to "count" the size of the chunk_list
			-> removed save() (is not used, nor will it be in the future)
			-> change the name of orderChunks() into arrangeChunks()
			
		snowflake.core.manager.ChunkManager
			-> changed mergeAvailableChunks(int) so that all Chunks in available_chunk_list will be
				transferred to the chunk_merging_manager
			-> added length-check in splitChunk(Chunk, long) for Chunks with a length of 1
				
		snowflake.api.chunk.IChunkManager
			-> changed  recycleChunks(Stream<Chunk>) so that it uses method-references
	
	
	
	2015.12.21
	
		snowflake.core.flake.FlakeDataManager
			-> changed addChunk(Chunk) - use chunk_list.isEmpty() instead of chunk_list.size() > 0



	2015.12.18
	
		snowflake.core.manager.ChunkManager
			-> introduced trimToSizeUnsafe() as a private analog to trimToSize() - it does not recycle the 
				chunk, but instead adds it to the list of available chunks - this method should only be used
				with chunks which already have been available, whose which have previously been cleaned up 
				(reduces the runtime of trimToSize() for large chunks dramatically!)
		
		snwoflake.api.flake.DataPointer
			-> added an increasePosition() and a decreasePosition() method (increments/decrements the
				position_in_flake by 1)
			-> renamed setter-methods for position_in_flake (removed the "InFlake")
			
		snowflake.core.stream
			-> moved the package to snowflake.api.stream
			
		snowflake.api.stream
			-> new stream-package (former snowflake.core.stream)
		
		snowflake.api.stream.FlakeInputStream
			-> now changes the position in the flake by the amount of read-in bytes
		
		snowflake.api.stream.FlakeOutputStream
			-> now changes the position in the flake by the amount of written bytes
			
		snowflake.api.flake.IFlake
			-> minor import-change
			
		snowflake.core.flake.Flake
			-> minor import-change
			-> getLength() now returns 0 when the instance is invalid
			
		snowflake.core.flake.FlakeStreamManager
			-> minor import-change
			
		snowflake.core.Chunk
			-> moved the class to the package snowflake.core.data
			
		snowflake.core.data
			-> added the class Chunk (former snowflake.core.Chunk)


	2015.12.17
	
		snowflake.core.manager.ChunkMergingManager
			-> debugged mergeChunks() - it actually works now
			-> added a contains method
			
		snowflake.core.manager.ChunkManager
			-> recycleChunk() now only "recycles" the chunk if the chunk is neither part of the 
			available_chunk_list or the chunk_merging_manager (instead of just plain adding it to the
				available_chunk_list)
				
		snowflake.core.manager.IndexManager
			-> fixed a tiny bug in loadConfiguration() (the position_in_input_buffer has not been reset)


	2015.12.16
		
		snowflake.core.manager.ChunkManager
			-> getAvailableChunks() did not trim chunks to the needed size
			-> getAvailableChunk() & getAvailableChunks() did not remove the chunks from the available_chunks_list,
			but instead kept them and gave them to multiple flake and sometimes multiple times to the same flake
			
		snowflake.core.flake.FlakeDataManager
			-> add() and insertChunk() will check if the certain chunk is already part of the flake and if so will
			throw a SecurityException
